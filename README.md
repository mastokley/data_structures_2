# data_structures_2

This repo contains work by Patrick Trompeter and Michael Stokely, performed as part of our Code Fellows Python 401 class in the Spring of 2016.

The Data Structures Included in this repo are:

    Binary Search Tree
    Hash Table

This Repo also contains our work on a series of sorting algorithms.  They are:

    Insertion
    Merge
    Radix
    Quicksort

All files have separate testing files, which should pass on both pyhton 2.7 and python 3.5 using tox.
